## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I've tried to minimize use of media queries by using the "clamp" function as much as possible to have a fluid responsiveness.

I've also tried to use HTML native functionalities (no js) to get styling of labels when clicked. So I used hidden radio buttons (so that only one can be clicked at each time) and connected labels, all sorrounded by a <div> so that I could style the sibling of the "clicked" radio button.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skills on modern CSS and HTML so to take advantage of all funtionality and limit more and more the use of media queries and javascript.
